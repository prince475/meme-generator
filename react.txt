1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
- State generally refer to the ways things currently are!

- in React though, state refers to the values that a component can maintain between render cycles.
A way for react to remember saved values from within a component.
This is similar to declaring variables from within a component, with a few added bonuses.

2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
- The easiest way is look at it, is like a regular JavaScript function.

- Props are like passing parameters into a function which the function then uses to help determine the output when it
gets returned. In react you would use props when you want to pass in data to a component which then that component
uses to determine what gets displayed on the screen or in other times uses that data to configure what is to be
displayed.



3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
- State is like when inside the body of a function and you declare new variables that will help you accomplish some task
with the function.
In React you would use state anytime you want a component to maintain its own values. Or anytime you want to maintain
some values from within the component. (And "remember" those values even when React re-renders the component)

4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
- immutable technically means unchanging.
- Props are immutable.
- state are mutable.
